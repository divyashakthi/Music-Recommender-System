# Music-Recommender-System
Recommends music based on the current mood of the user, analyzed via their respective audio input.

As the user speaks, the audio is converted into text, and each word is analysed to determine the user's current mood.
Further, the percentage of each mood is calculated and the respective mood playlist is accessed from spotify.
A song is played at random from the playlist in the browser.
